# TPUCryptoAPIFrameworkPro

## Description

Initial project setup

## Features

- Leverages TPU v5e architecture to accelerate homomorphic encryption operations by up to 10x compared to CPU-based implementations.
- Integrates a hardware-backed key management system (HSM) for secure storage and generation of cryptographic keys, adhering to FIPS 140-2 Level 3 standards.
- Optimizes the execution of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, specifically CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, using TPU-specific instructions.
- Supports differential privacy mechanisms, implementing randomized response and Laplace mechanisms with configurable privacy budgets (epsilon and delta).
- Enables secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocols, such as Shamir's Secret Sharing and Garbled Circuits, with optimized communication patterns for TPU clusters.
- Implements a custom memory allocator designed for TPU memory architecture, minimizing data transfer overhead and improving memory utilization for cryptographic workloads.
- Provides a Python API with gRPC bindings for seamless integration with existing machine learning pipelines and deployment environments.
- Verifies the integrity of cryptographic operations using formally verified code and hardware attestation, ensuring resistance to side-channel attacks.
